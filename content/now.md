_This is my [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about), what's been happening in my life recently?_

I'm working with the fine folks at [Midnyte City](https://midnytecity.com.au/), and was recently promoted to Senior Software Engineer!

I'm playing with Glen Eira Band, Western Brass and Footscray-Yarraville City Band. Every now and then I do the odd job with an orchestra or wind band too.

After running [my first half-marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/14369724515) in May I've taken a bit of a break from running and riding. I'm targeting some events in early 2026 to get back on track, plus more social runs and rides!
