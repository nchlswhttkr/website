When you interact with my website, your requests are handled by a few data processors/services.

I value privacy and dislike invasive tracking mechanisms, so the best I can do is avoid them in my website and personal projects.

I've put this document together to be open about how I operate.

## Browsing nicholas.cloud

I use a number services to operate my website.

-   Most traffic for my website flows through [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/), you can consult their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/privacypolicy/) for data collected about end users
-   I host this blog in [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/)
-   I process some telemetry about traffic to my website with [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io/)

## Reading my newsletter

I send out a semi-regular newsletter to readers who opt in to receive it. Every newsletter includes a link to unsubscribe.

### Mailgun

I use [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) to send these newsletters, and manage the list of subscribed readers. You can read their [privacy policy](https://www.mailgun.com/privacy-policy/) to understand how they manage data stored on their platform.

I only keep a record of email addresses that have subscribed/unsubscribed. I don't use tracking pixels or targeted links to track reader activity.
