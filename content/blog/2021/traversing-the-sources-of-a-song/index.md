I stumbled across an old animation from a few years ago yesterday, set to a rather funky beat. Not the most fascinating thing on its own. Interesting though, how my perspective has changed a bit after looking into the music a little bit more.

By itself, the song is great. There's more lurking beneath the surface though.

It uses the vocals from _Fire Fly_ by Childish Gambino.

The vocals are mashed up with the instrumental from MF DOOM's _Coffin Nails_.

DOOM uses a sample from Dave Matthews' guitar solo in _Space Oddity_.

Travere the tree, and you're listening to a mashup with a sample from a cover of a David Bowie song!

Isn't it funny how deep the roots of a song can reach?
