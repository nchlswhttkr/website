I stumbled upon a annotated release of the soundtrack to the video game [Journey](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)>). The game was a favourite of mine when I was younger, and I still regularly listen to the soundtrack out of nostalgia.

My favourite song, _The Road of Trials_, scores a particularly iconic moment of the game as the player character surfs through a valley of sand. However, the most iconic moment to my ear is a note attack from the flute that's near-indistinguishable from the "email received" notification sound of Apple devices.

So when reading composer Austin Wintory notes about writing and recording this soundtrack, I was surprised to see the musical moment mentioned [around 25 seconds into the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=995&v=AAw87rrzBhY).

> _No, that was not your iMail sound! Apparently, a flute playing F# is very similar, but being an Android user I never noticed! We caught it during the mix and removed it from the game. It remained on the album... perhaps a mistake ;)_

So there you have it, a tidbit of musical trivia for your day!

You can also listen to a [direct comparison of the two sound bites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=995&v=AAw87rrzBhY) from Journey's music editor, Ted Kocher. You can also buy a complete copy of the soundtrack from [Austin's Bandcamp](https://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/journey) shop.
