Late last year, I grabbed the original Ace Attorney trilogy on discount after stumbling across [a trending fan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMwDT6BhhE). I've now played through all six mainline games, and I'm optimistic for a seventh to coincide with the series' 20th anniversary later this year.

While a new game isn't confirmed, Capcom will be releasing [a localised bundle of The Great Ace Attorney 1 & 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seA5Rc4lxzs) in a few months. This duo was previously exclusive to Japan, and it's exiting to see them getting an international release.

A feature being introduced in the game is [Story Mode](https://twitter.com/aceattorneygame/status/1397598597152190466), where the game will automatically play itself on the player's behalf. Some internet shadows are criticising the _optional_ feature, saying it removes the logic puzzles and problem solving the series is founded upon.

A reply to the critics captures the motivation behind this feature simply and succinctly. Every player should have the opportunity to experience these games, without the needless trial-and-error that the games can sometimes be guilty (_ha!_) of.

> You won't [need story mode], but some might. This isn't for you, it's for them.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to contradiction hunting on July 27th!
