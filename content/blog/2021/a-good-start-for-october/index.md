Somehow, we're now into the final quarter of the year. Here's a few things that interest me, and may interest you!

[Hacktoberfest is back for another year](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/hacktoberfest-is-back-2021/), hopefully the controls they introduced after the terrible spam-fest of 2020 will avoid creating too much work for maintainers. It's nice to see that they're making merge requests on GitLab eligible too, and highlighting financial contributions as a way to support open source software.

A friend of mine in the UK is running [a Kickstarter campaign to sell enamel Pikachu pins](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peachsage/cute-pikachu-pins), if pins are your thing.

Today is also [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com), where Bandcamp waives their service fee for sales. It's an excellent opportunity to support smaller/local artists and independent labels.

Here's five albums I've been listening to recently.

{{< bandcamp-album nadjenoordhuis indigo >}}

I saw Nadje [perform with Luke Howard](/blog/live-music-has-returned-to-melbourne/) when we weren't in lockdown earlier this year. The world needs more gentle trumpet and flugel soloists, her sound is honey for my ears.

{{< bandcamp-album beastlykeysbrad the-samba-and-crunk-ep >}}

Brad's a Melbourne-based funk keys player, he [livestreams a few times each week on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/beastlykeysbrad). In fact, he's live as I write this!

{{< bandcamp-album hellosatellites theres-a-field >}}

Hello Satellites was [one of the performances I attended at Tempo Rubato in Brunswick](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQdaEO9jGkJ/) before the most recent bout of lockdowns. First time I've seen a harp live too!

{{< bandcamp-album jordanrakei what-we-call-life >}}

Jordan Rakei's voice is magical, and his new album sounds incredible. I've been thoroughly enjoying it this last week.

{{< bandcamp-album theokatzman my-heart-is-live-in-berlin >}}

I love him on Vulfpeck and I love him as a solo artist, Theo is a powerhouse with his voice and guitar. He's got three great albums under his belt now, and this live album is great introduction in my opinion.

Happy listening!
