I'm a developer with a passion for web development and automation!

In my spare time, I rehearse and play with brass bands and orchestras around my hometown of Melbourne, Australia.

You might also find me playing the odd game of lawn bowls.

### About

I studied Computer Science at Monash University and helped launch [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu/), a course planning service built for students by students.

I've been involved in running workshops, hackathons and events for IT students as a volunteer and committee member with [WIRED](https://wired.org.au/). Currently, I'm a part of the logistics crew with [UNIHACK](https://unihack.net/), organising Australia's largest hackathon for university students.

I always try to be public about what I'm learning and working on, in the hope that I can help others learn new things too! You can find most of my work either covered in [my blog](/) or published on [GitHub](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr/).
